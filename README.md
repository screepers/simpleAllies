# Simple Allies
Allows for simple communication between allies using a public segment

## Usage

Plug this into your screeps bot and begin communicating with allies!

- priority values should be from 0-1, where 1 is most preferred and 0 is least preferred
- avoid sending verbose data! The more data you send, the more expensive it is for your allies to parse and read it.
